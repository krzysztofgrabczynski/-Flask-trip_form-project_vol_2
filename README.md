This is the second version of the Trip form project on my github. If you want to check the previous version [click here.](https://github.com/krzysztofgrabczynski/Flask-trip_form-project)


## <p align=center> How it works </p>

Basically, the main idea is to select the specific trip form (as a guest) that can be added only by users with a valid account on this site. Users add new forms where they enter information about the trip and their contact details like email. User can edit his own account (changing password, email) and only his own specific trip form. In addition there is administrator account that can edit users accounts and all trip forms.

This version is more advanced than the previous one and has new features:

- [ ] An uncompleted task
- [x] A completed task

## <p align=center> How to run the application </p>
- Copy the repository 
- Create virtual environment using 'python -m venv venv' in project directory
- Use '. venv/Scripts/activate' to activate the virtual environment
- Install required packages by 'pip install -r pip_install_req.txt'
